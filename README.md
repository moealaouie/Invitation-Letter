# Birthday Invitation Generator

## Overview

This Python program automates the process of creating personalized invitation letters for a birthday event. It reads names from a specified text file and generates individual text files containing personalized invitations for each name listed.

## Requirements

- **Python**: The script is written in Python and requires Python 3.x to run.
- **File System**: Required directories and files should be set up as described in the File Structure section below.

## File Structure

- **Input/Names/invited_names.txt**: This text file should contain the names of individuals to invite, with one name per line. Ensure each name is on a new line without any leading or trailing spaces.
- **Output/ReadyToSend/**: This directory will contain the output text files with the invitations. Ensure this directory exists, or modify the script to create it if missing.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare the Names File**: Populate `Input/Names/invited_names.txt` with the names of all individuals you wish to invite. Each name should be on a separate line.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment. You can run the script from a terminal or command prompt as follows:
   ```main.py```
